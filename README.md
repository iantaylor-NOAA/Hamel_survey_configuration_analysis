**Hamel et al. 2020 Survey Configuration Paper**

Code here depends on model files not included on GitHub. The model files are on the NWFSC network drive and bundled together in a saved R workspace file: \\nwcfile.nmfs.local\FRAM\Assessments\SurveyConfigurationEvaluation\Apr13_2018.Rdata

Remaking the figures requres sourcing the following 3 R functions:
- /R/configuration_figure.R (for Fig 1)
- /R/survey_config_index_plot.R (for Fig 2)
- /R/survey_config_notes.R (for Figs 3-5, plus code related to tables--see note at the top of the file)
